### gdpc

This package (currently under development!) provides functions for computing the Generalized Dynamic Principal Components proposed in Pe√±a and Yohai (2016). The number of components can be supplied by the user or chosen automatically so that a given proportion of variance is explained. The number of lags is chosen automatically using one of the following criteria: Leave-one-out cross-validation, an AIC type criterion, a BIC type criterion or a criterion based on a proposal of Bai and Ng (2002).

### Installation

You can install the **development** version from [GitHub](https://github.com/esmucler/gdpc)

``` r
devtools::install_github("esmucler/gdpc")
```

### Usage

``` r
library(gdpc)
#Load and plot Industrial Production Index Data
data(ipi91)
plot(ipi91, plot.type = 'multiple', main = 'Industrial Production Index')
```

![](README-unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)

``` r
#Choose number of lags among 0, \dots, 9 using the Leave One Out criterion
gdpc_ipi <- auto.gdpc(ipi91, k_max = 9, niter_max = 1500, ncores = 4)
#> [1] "Computing component number 1"
#> [1] "Total number of computed components: 1"
gdpc_ipi

#> Component 1              9 8.471 7.778              0.948
#Plot the component
plot(gdpc_ipi, which_comp = 1, ylab = '')
```

``` r
#Get fitted values and plot
fit_val <- fitted(gdpc_ipi[[1]])
colnames(fit_val) <- colnames(ipi91)
plot(fit_val, main = 'Fitted values')
```
